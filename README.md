## Description
My take on the 1987 Nintendo classic Punch Out game. The idea was to showcase a clear understanding of mainly player movement and input, enemy ai, animations, UI Canvas, and Sound FX.

## Project Setup
The game is playable via Windows or OS.

- Download build for Windows or Mac [Here]( https://github.com/Ken-Mens/Punch_Out/tree/main/Assets/Builds).
- Open Menu Scene first once build has finished installing.
- Launch Round One Scene. 

## How to Play

- You can move the  main character using either WASD or arrow keys to walk across the ring.
- Use the F key to strike/punch
- Use the G key to block/defend

At the top of the screen you should see the UI canvas which shows player and enemy health. Interactive UI includes pause, play, and restart buttons.
